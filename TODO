- cleanup logging approach in Abstract
- cleanup Abstract...looking for config file and all get rid of dirname( ...blabla assumptions
- what if worker name is my_worker  ..get rid of magic  _ to / conversion

1. leave only workers, managers,eventstats,tweety
2. general configuration and config per worker



- thing of project name
- improve configuration..should be easier
- create dummy worker
- add comments on each method/function
- non versioned config files should provide default template so people just rename file and edit
- add simple use cases - howto run worker, howto add new worker
- release
